# Belly Button Biodiversity Study

Description
---
> An interactive dashboard to explore the <a href="https://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/" target="_blank">Belly Button Biodiversity Dataset</a>, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
>
> This project uses the D3 Javascript library and Plotly to create an interactive dashboard that allows the user to compare bacteria from different test subjects. The analysis includes a bar chart of the top 10 bacteria present for the selected sample, and a bubble chart that showcases the values of each bacteria. The charts dynamically change based on the sample selected from the dropdown menu.
